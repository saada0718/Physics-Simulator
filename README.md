The purpose of this project was for me become more familiar with full-stack. The program states the x-location, y-location, and speed at any given time. The person can let the ball roll down a ramp or let the ball drop. A person cannot perform the two tasks simultaniously; thus, the buttons are disabled. The velocity and the acceleration of the ball are accurate.
